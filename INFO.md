# To-do

**Soon**

- Player can get stunned (never killed because plot armor)
- Start working on UI
- Deploy tells you where helpers will spawn
- Deploy wont work if any are outside of the borders
- Fix helper angle while attacking
- Better camera movement
- Dotted line to show bow range

**Later**

- Wall explodes when broken
- Different shops (two?)
- Only able to shop between rounds
- Hopefully 50 rounds
- Animated bowstring??
- Add plot armor as an item? hehe
- Less choppy fighter reorientation
- Health bars?
- Bosses?
- Be able to move popup menus to the opposite side of the screen
- Building and deploying have a delay

# Ideas

- No rarities, but a sort of power value thing that lets weapon scale up
- Towers exist too :>

# Terms

**Alignments:**

- 'you'
- 'enemy'
